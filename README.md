# belly-button-challenge

Written by: Tristan Perry

This project contains a JavaScript source code (app.js) that connects to the included data (samples.json) using d3, sourced from http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/. Data contains information on biodiversity in samples taken from belly buttons. A sample number can be selected from a dropdown menu. This data is displayed with visualizations, including a bar chart of the most abundant bacteria in each sample, as well as a bubble chart and a panel displaying metadata relating to the selected sample, such as demographic information.
